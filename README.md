# BACKGROUND
As you know that the film industry had emerged at the start of the 19th century between a sequence of technical growths. It evolved swiftly and due to its expenses, it continued to stay well put. At the moment we all know that the film industry is somewhere known to be the biggest due to its popularity and market value.

In this project, I will look to utilise genuine trending data from the IMDb website which technically stores information of films using an online database. During the course of this project, my objective will be to implement a Data Acquisition & Pre-processing Pipeline for the film data. Through this I will look to process data of the “Top 1000” films based on their popularity from IMDb.

# OBJECTIVE
o	Obtain data of the most popular 1000 films\
o	Collect data of directors with the longest film (Top 5)\
o	Fetch data of directors with the highest film score (Top 10)\
o	Acquire data of directors with the highest film rating (Top 10)\
o	Collect data of directors with the highest film votes (Top 5)\
o	Fetch data of directors with the highest film gross (Top 15)\
o	Acquire data of the total amount of films along with the years which they released\
o	Collect data of the average rating, score, votes  & gross based on the film total\
o	Acquire data of film categories which has the most votes (Top 3)\
o	Fetch the correlation data of films rating, score, votes & gross\
o	Visualize all the collected data\
o	Load data into a database

# REQUIREMENTS
o	Data to be acquired through an API\
o	Data to be extracted, normalised & stored into a data-frame\
o	Data to be cleaned (get rid of the missing values)\
o	Data to be visualised (Matplotlib & Seaborn)\
o	Data to be connected to a database
